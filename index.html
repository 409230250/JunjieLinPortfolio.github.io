				<h2>Personal Information<h2>

			<content>
				<p>My name is Junjie Lin. My family and I moved to the United States seven years ago, 
					we settled at San Francisco. I was glad that I can attend to UCI for studying Computer Science 
					after graduating from Mission High School of SF. I am a senior this year and ready to graduate as well! </p>
				<p>I enjoy playing basketball. I play because I have a love for the game. 
				I played basketball for CUU in San Francisco two years ago.</p>
				<p>My programming skills are Python and Java. I have been learned and used Python for 
					three years, Java for one year; I like using them for their syntaxs are understandable 
					by reading the code. I have been tutoring for ICS students in Python and Java for two years.</p>
